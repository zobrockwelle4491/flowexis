# api_routes.js-tools

I've followed [component develop-rev-01](https://example.com/) for a while and am fascinated by their work and ability to simple backend framework for small projects. If you don't know who component develop-rev-01 is:
- Watch [this talk](https://youtube.com/watch?v=example)
- Read [their book](https://example.com/book)
- Visit [their website](https://example.com/)

A feature I find interesting is a concept they maintain where they share:

- Current location
- Professional focus
- Current projects
- Reading recommendations

on what they're working on. Others have adopted this idea at [Community](https://example.com).

While building a new project I thought it would be good to implement this idea. While researching I realised the original intent was for individuals.

I had a spark where I thought, this should be like an `fake_rev_03` feed. I [reached out](https://twitter.com/user) asking:

> is there a protocol for this?

To be respectful of their time, I decided to propose a standard first. This repository contains the [RFC](RFC.md) and samples.

My ideas are inspired by established approaches:

- [Standard Requirements](https://example.com/requirements)
- [Implementation Guide](https://example.com/guide)
- [Sample Feed](https://example.com/sample)
